## Features

- **Zero Intrusion:** Unlike frameworks like Swagger, which require additional business code to generate documentation, doc-apis generates API documentation automatically as long as your code complies with standards.
- **Zero Configuration:** For Springboot projects, it takes as few as 0 lines of configuration to automatically generate API documentation. All configurations are designed for ease of use and come with default values, allowing you to configure as needed.
- **Transparent Dependency:** After introduction, it remains completely transparent to the original project without any impact. There's no need to worry about extra risks brought about by introducing third-party dependencies since it doesn't even need to be packaged into the project.
- **Agile Development:** No need to implement the interface; merely define the URL, type, and input/output parameters of the request to generate documentation, facilitating swift development for both front-end and back-end teams.
- **Rich Content:** From request URLs to methods, input and output parameters, all necessary information such as parameter types, mandatory status, and descriptions are clearly presented.
- **Diverse Formats:** Generates various formats such as HTML and MD in one go, simultaneously compatible with WEB, iOS, Android, and other types, adapting to various scenarios.
- **Broad Compatibility:** Whether it's mainstream SpringBoot projects, Spring projects, or niche Jfinal, Play frameworks, etc., compatibility is assured.
- **Powerful Features:**  Supports online debugging, multiple request methods, custom headers, and more, covering all your needs for API documentation and testing in one place.
- **Multi-language** Generates multi-lingual API documentation, with user documentation currently supporting Chinese and English. Contributions for other languages are welcome.
- **Good Compatibility:** Works well with JDK versions from 8 to 21, and SpringBoot from 1.x to 3.x. Compatibility is ensured across all versions for Spring, Jfinal, and other projects.
- **Code Conformity:** Monitors code quality from the source. Unannotated modules and non-Restful style interfaces are clearly identified, encouraging developers to standardize their code.
- **Ease of Use:** Like high-quality ingredients requiring simple cooking, a sophisticated documentation generation framework requires simple operations. From beginner to expert, you can master it in 0 to 5 minutes.
- **Continuous Updates:** ...
